        <p>Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009) was an <u>American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist</u>. Dubbed the <b>"King of Pop"</b>, he is widely regarded as one of the most culturally significant figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his music achievements broke racial barriers in the US and made him a dominant figure worldwide. Through his songs, stages, and fashion, he proliferated visual performance for artists in popular music, popularizing street dance moves such as the <i>moonwalk, the robot and the anti-gravity lean</i>. Jackson is often deemed the greatest entertainer of all time.</p>
